# Image Resources

This directory should contain 4 PNG images for the watchface grid:

- `image_0.png` - Top-left image (56x72 pixels)
- `image_1.png` - Top-right image (56x72 pixels)  
- `image_2.png` - Bottom-left image (56x72 pixels)
- `image_3.png` - Bottom-right image (56x72 pixels)

## Image Requirements

- **Format**: PNG
- **Dimensions**: 56x72 pixels each
- **Color**: Should work with Pebble's display (black & white for Pebble 2, or color for Pebble Time)

## Creating Placeholder Images

If you need to create placeholder images, you can:

1. Use any image editor to create 56x72 pixel PNG files
2. Or use online tools to generate simple placeholder images
3. The images will be automatically converted to Pebble's resource format during build

## Notes

- The images are referenced in `appinfo.json` in the resources section
- Resource IDs are auto-generated by the Pebble SDK during build
- Make sure the filenames match exactly: `image_0.png`, `image_1.png`, `image_2.png`, `image_3.png`
